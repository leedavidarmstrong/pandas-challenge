Project Title: PyCity Schools Analyses
Project Description: This project involves a comprehensive analysis of school and standardized test data within a local government area. The goal is to assist the school board and mayor in making strategic decisions related to school budgets and priorities. By analysing area-wide standardized test results and student math and reading scores, the project aims to identify significant trends in school performance and provide a high-level snapshot of key metrics in the local government area's education landscape.
Summary of Analyses: The dataset encompasses 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students. On average, math scores are around 70.34, while reading scores are approximately 69.98. Passing rates for math and reading are 86.08% and 84.43%, respectively, resulting in an overall passing rate of 72.81%. Notably, reading scores slightly lag math scores. The schools are evenly divided between government and independent types, with government schools receiving a larger portion of the budget. However, independent schools tend to outperform government schools in terms of passing rates.
Comparisons
Budget Allocation Impact: Despite government schools receiving a larger budget share, independent schools outperform them in terms of passing rates.
School Size Influence: Small schools (less than 1000 students) exhibit better passing rates and performance compared to larger schools. Medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) maintain a balance between passing rates and performance. Large schools (2000-5000 students) face challenges in maintaining passing rates and performance compared to smaller counterparts.
Conclusions
The analysis indicates that allocating more resources to schools can positively impact performance. Schools with lower spending per student may need additional support to improve academic outcomes. There's a need to investigate the reasons behind performance disparities between government and independent schools. Targeted interventions can bridge the gap between average scores and passing thresholds. Small schools' success might be attributed to personalized attention, while larger schools could benefit from enhanced student engagement strategies.
In conclusion, the analysis uncovers important trends in school performance, highlighting the influence of budget allocation and school size on outcomes. Despite having a smaller budget share, independent schools showcase impressive performance. The project's findings can guide resource allocation and the implementation of targeted interventions to enhance education quality in the local government area.
